== Introduction

Agile development or simply agile is a software methodology development that promotes the flexibility, interactivity and transparency <<Szalvay-2004>>.  

Agile software development projects are based on the nature of evolving (not fixed) requirements, (re-) usable code and the continous testing. This methodology (see <<agile_elem, Table 1>> ) key elements are:

|Description

|Stories/User Stories
|Refers to the user requirements that also corresponds with product features.

|Sprint Backlog
|The collection of work scheduled for a sprint. At the begining of each sprint, the team decides the work to do during the sprint. These tasks should be organised by priority.

|Global backlog (or icebox)
| A collection of all user-stories. When a new user-story is defined, it is stored in the global backlog for their selection. Thus, the development team select them and introduce into the sprint. The main intention is to priorize as well the tasks for making simple their selection.

|Sprints
| Iteration cycles of the development cycle. Normaly 2-4 weeks. The main objective is to provide a small development (or prototype) to the customers.
|===

The agile development cycle (<<img-agile, Figure 1>>) starts with the definition of the product backlog (user-stories, featues, etc.). During the spring planning, stories are selected to be implemented. Thus, it pass to the sprint backlog. 

During the sprint development the stories are implemented and evaluated during 1-4 weeks. Each day during the sprint, several daily scrum meetings are performed to evaluate the work, the level of accomplishent and the project execution. Then, burndown and velocity charts are revised to see if the sprint is delayed, on time or faster than expected. 

At the end of each sprint, a sprint review is performed in order to underestand the mistakes (learn from the experience). Moreover, the product is provided to the customer and a feedback from user is received, an new stories could appear.

== Agile Methodology in Github & Zenhub

The agile methodology is fully compatible with Github and Zenhub. In detail, Github provides a framework for managing documents (code, text, etc), coutinous follow-up of the project (using the Wiki, for example), and more important, managing the product releases (output of each spint). 

Complementary, Zenhub provides a kanban model for managing the global backlogs, sprint backlogs, provide burndown reports, managing the isues life-cycle and, define objectives (sprints and product releases).

Considering these overall description of the Github and Zenhub usage, the <<agile_ict, Table 2>> provide the association between Agile and the depicted tools.

== Hands on Github and Zenhub

[NOTE]
.Customer need
====
eCORP, a larger company in business development, wants to elaborate the curse documentation for training their customers and employes. With this regards, we need to manage the development and resources to do it efficiently in 1 week.

=== STEP 1. Initialise Github

To initialise Github, it is necesary to go to https://github.com. Once in the github page, you have to log in or sign in into the platform. 

[#img-gsignin] 
.GitHub Sign In page

Once the Github is created, the next step is to log in the platform and create a new repository. 

[#img-gmainpage] 
.GitHub main user page
image::../resources/Githubmain.png[]

In the page of creating a new repository, you have to fill the form including a repository name, description, nature of the repository, and some files for the init (readme and licence files). Once specified this parameters, press the buton create the repository to start working. 

[#img-grepocreation] 
.GitHub Github init repository
image::../resources/grepocreation.png[]

Yo have your repository created!!!! Now, browse to the repository to start working with Github. 

[#img-grepopage] 
.GitHub repository main view
image::../resources/grepopage.png[]

Considering the repository, the main part is the code repository. But before starting with it, we will start with the Wiki (<<gwiki, Figure 6>>). The Wiki will store the sprint planning meeting, daily scrum meeting and sprint review. Moreover, it will serve also to store some ideas or additional information relevant for the project. 

[#img-gwiki] 
.Wiki for storing the meetings minutes

==== Sprint Planning Meeting

The sprint planning meeting will cover the agenda for passing the main issues from the backlog to the sprint backlog according to the customer requirements and feedbacks.
