== Hands on Github and Zenhub

[quote]
eCORP, a larger company in business development, wants to elaborate the curse documentation for training their customers and employes. With this regards, we need to manage the development and resources to do it efficiently in 1 week.

== STEP 1: Initialise Github

== STEP 2: Continous documentation of Agile Meetings

Continous documentation of agile meetings for maintaning the team update: 

[%step]

For the sprint planning assign issues from the product backlog into the milestone and move the issue the column. 

== STEP 5: Sprint Planning

[quote]
One method to know how is going the sprint is by the burndown graph. In Zenhub, this is placed inside Reports.

Prototype generation to show it to the customer. Here we explore two aspects:  Release planning management (Zenhub), Release placement (Github)
